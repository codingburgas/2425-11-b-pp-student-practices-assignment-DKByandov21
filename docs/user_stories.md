## Definition of Done

A user story is considered "Done" when:

## Story Estimation

Story points are estimated using the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13):

- **1 point**: Very simple, can be completed in a few hours
- **2 points**: Simple, can be completed in half a day
- **3 points**: Medium complexity, can be completed in a day
- **5 points**: Complex, requires 2-3 days
- **8 points**: Very complex, requires a week
- **13 points**: Extremely complex, should be broken down

## Velocity Tracking

Team velocity is calculated as the sum of story points completed per sprint:

- **Sprint 1**: Target 12 points
- **Sprint 2**: Target 12 points
- **Sprint 3**: Target 12 points
- **Sprint 4**: Target 11 points
- **Sprint 5**: Target 8 points
- **Sprint 6**: Target 9 points

**Total Estimated Effort**: 64 story points
